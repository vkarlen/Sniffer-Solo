# Sniffer

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Sniffer designed to help the average pet parent manage their dog's food allergies and connect them with foods that fit their pooch's specific needs. In this app, you can create a profile for your dog where you can list known sensitivities, as well as track every food you've tried and how they did on it. Each profile features a "Sniff Out a New Food" button that brings the user to a search tailored specifically to their dog, showing only food that do not contain the ingredients they're sensitive to. Sniffer also has a comparison tool that allows the user to feed in two foods and instantly see any overlapping ingredients so they can more quickly zero in on what their pup is reacting to.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `sniffer_db`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and `sniffer_data.zip` has all the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
